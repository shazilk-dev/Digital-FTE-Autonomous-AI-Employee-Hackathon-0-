## Active Projects

| Project | Client / Context | Due Date | Priority | Status |
|---------|-----------------|----------|----------|--------|
| TODO: Project name | TODO: Client or internal | TODO date | High | In Progress |
| TODO: Project name | TODO: Client or internal | TODO date | Medium | Planning |
| TODO: Project name | TODO: Client or internal | TODO date | Low | Backlog |

> TODO: Replace with your actual active projects. The AI Employee uses this table to

## Subscription Audit Rules

The AI Employee will flag subscriptions in `/Accounting/` that violate these rules.

### Auto-Flag Conditions
- Monthly cost > $TODO for a single tool with no active project link
- Duplicate tools that serve the same purpose (e.g., two project management tools)
- Subscriptions not used in the past 30 days (no associated tasks or files)
- Annual subscriptions due for renewal within 14 days

### Keep List (Never Flag)
```
TODO: List tools you want excluded from audit alerts.
Example:
- Figma (design — daily use)
- GitHub Copilot (dev productivity — active)
- Notion (knowledge base — always on)
```

### Review Threshold
- Individual tool: > $TODO / month → flag for review
- Total software spend: > $TODO / month → generate cost report

> TODO: Set your actual dollar thresholds above.

---

## Content Pillars (LinkedIn & Social)

The AI Employee aligns post drafts to these themes:

1. **TODO: Pillar 1** — e.g., "Automation & Productivity"
2. **TODO: Pillar 2** — e.g., "Entrepreneurship & Lessons Learned"
3. **TODO: Pillar 3** — e.g., "Industry Insights & Trends"

> TODO: Define 2–4 content pillars that reflect your brand. Posts not aligned to a pillar
> will be flagged for human review before scheduling.

---

## Notes for the AI Employee

- When a new email or task arrives from a client listed in Active Projects above, automatically bump priority by one level.
- When MRR target is less than 50% achieved by month end, include a flag in the weekly briefing.
- LinkedIn posts should reference the content pillars above — do not post off-topic content autonomously.
- Subscription audit runs on the 1st of each month; output a report to `/Briefings/`.
