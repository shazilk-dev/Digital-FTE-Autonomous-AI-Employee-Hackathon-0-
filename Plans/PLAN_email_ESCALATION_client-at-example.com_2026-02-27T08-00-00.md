## Triage Summary

**Category:** ESCALATION
**Priority:** Critical
**Sender:** Client A <client@example.com> (Unknown — requires approval per Handbook)

## Analysis

Client A is demanding payment on invoice #2024-001 for $5,000 which is reportedly 30 days overdue, and explicitly threatens to "escalate" if not resolved. The subject line contains "URGENT" — a sensitive keyword per the Company Handbook — which automatically elevates this to ESCALATION category. This is also a financial dispute ($5,000), requiring human approval before any action is taken per the Approval Matrix.
