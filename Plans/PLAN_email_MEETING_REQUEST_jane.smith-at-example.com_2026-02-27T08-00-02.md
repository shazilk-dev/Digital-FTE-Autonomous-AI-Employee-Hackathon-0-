## Analysis

Jane Smith is requesting confirmation of attendance at a Q1 strategy meeting scheduled for Thursday at 2pm, with an offer to send a calendar invite. No sensitive keywords are present and there is no financial component. The sender (jane.smith@example.com) is not listed as a configured contact in the Handbook (the Handbook TODO section references a different address), so this is treated as an unknown contact and requires human approval before responding.
