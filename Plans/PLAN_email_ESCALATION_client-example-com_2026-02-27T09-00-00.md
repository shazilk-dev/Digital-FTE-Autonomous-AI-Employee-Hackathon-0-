## Triage Summary

**Category:** ESCALATION
**Priority:** Critical
**Sender:** Client A (client@example.com) — Contact tier unconfirmed (not in Handbook VIP list)
**Subject:** URGENT: Overdue Invoice #2024-001

## Analysis

Client A is asserting that invoice #2024-001 for $5,000 is 30 days overdue and is
threatening to escalate the matter if payment is not processed immediately. The email
contains the sensitive keywords "URGENT" and "escalate," and the matter involves a
significant financial obligation ($5,000), both of which trigger ESCALATION classification
per Company Handbook rules. No response should be drafted or sent without human review.

## Recommended Actions

- [ ] Human to verify the status of invoice #2024-001 in /Accounting/
- [ ] Human to confirm whether Client A is a known, authorized contact (add to Handbook Tier 1 if so)
- [ ] Human to approve a response and/or initiate payment if invoice is valid
- [ ] If invoice is disputed, do NOT reply autonomously — consult human before any communication

## Draft Response (if REPLY_NEEDED)

No auto-draft generated for ESCALATION category. A human must review the invoice
status and authorize any reply. Suggested response upon approval:

> Hi,
>
> Thank you for your message. We are reviewing invoice #2024-001 and will follow up
> with you shortly to confirm the status and next steps.
>
> Apologies for any inconvenience.
>
> Best regards
