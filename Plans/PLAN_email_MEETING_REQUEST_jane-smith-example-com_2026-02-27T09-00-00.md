## Triage Summary

**Category:** MEETING_REQUEST
**Priority:** High
**Sender:** Jane Smith (jane.smith@example.com) — Unknown contact (not listed in Handbook)
**Subject:** Q1 Strategy Meeting — Can you attend Thursday?

## Analysis

Jane Smith is requesting attendance at a Q1 strategy meeting proposed for Thursday at
2:00 PM. The sender is not currently listed in the Company Handbook's known contacts,
so per Handbook rules this requires human approval before any reply is sent. The
meeting subject (Q1 strategy) appears legitimate and business-relevant, but confirmation
of the sender's identity and relationship is needed before committing to attendance.

## Recommended Actions

- [ ] Human to confirm if Jane Smith is a known contact and at which tier
- [ ] Human to check calendar availability for Thursday at 2:00 PM
- [ ] If approved, reply to confirm attendance and accept the calendar invite
- [ ] If Jane Smith is a recurring contact, add her to the Handbook known contacts list

## Draft Response (if REPLY_NEEDED)

Hi Jane,

Thank you for the invitation. I'd be happy to join the Q1 strategy meeting on Thursday
at 2:00 PM — please go ahead and send the calendar invite.

Looking forward to it.

Best regards
