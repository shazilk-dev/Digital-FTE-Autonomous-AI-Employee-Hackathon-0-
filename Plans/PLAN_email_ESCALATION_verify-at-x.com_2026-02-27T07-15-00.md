## Triage Summary

**Category:** ESCALATION
**Priority:** High
**Sender:** X <verify@x.com> (Automated platform notification — Unknown/System)
**Subject:** New login to X from ChromeDesktop on Windows

## Analysis

X (formerly Twitter) sent a security notification alerting that a new login was detected on account @sk_techi from a ChromeDesktop on Windows, with an approximate location of Karachi, Pakistan. This is a security alert that requires human review to confirm whether the login was authorized. If the login was not made by the account owner, immediate action is required (password change, revoking app access).

Note: A companion email (EMAIL_verify@x.com_2026-02-26T16-51-34_1.md) confirms that the X account password has since been changed, suggesting the user may have already taken action.

## Recommended Actions

- [ ] Confirm whether the login from ChromeDesktop/Windows (Karachi, Pakistan) on 2026-02-08 was authorized
- [ ] If unauthorized: verify password was changed and review connected third-party apps at https://x.com/settings/applications
- [ ] If authorized: no further action needed — archive this plan
- [ ] Check account @sk_techi for any suspicious activity or unauthorized posts

## Draft Response

No response needed. (Automated notification from X — no reply required.)

## Approval Required

This action requires your approval. Review the analysis above, then:
- To approve (confirm login was authorized, no further action): move this plan to /Approved/
- To reject/escalate (login was NOT authorized — account may be compromised): move this plan to /Rejected/ and take immediate steps to secure account
